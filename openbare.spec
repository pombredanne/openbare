%description
openbare is a digital asset library system, implemented on Django.

The system started out with the intend to provide access to Public Cloud
accounts for everyone at SUSE. At the onset of the project is was hoped that
implementation of the framework could be sufficiently generalized to provide
functionality for pretty much anything that one might keep track of that
fits the concept of a Public Library. Once the first plugin was developed
to manage AWS IAM access this hope was realized and the project moved from
a private repository to a public repository in the hopes that others will
find the system useful and will contribute back to the project.

We'd like to thank SUSE for sponsoring our work and enabling us to set up the
project in a company independent way.
